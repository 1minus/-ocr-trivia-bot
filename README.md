# Python Trivia Bot
Basic Python Bot to solve trivia.

This basic bot uses PIL and PyTesseract to capture and convert images into strings for parsing later on. Google's custom search API is then used to search the question while a counter for each answer keeps track of the number of hits returned. The most hits return as the most probable answer.
